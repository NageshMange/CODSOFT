Overview-

Codsoft Internship - C++ Projects During my internship at Codsoft, I explored real-world problem-solving using C++. This repository showcases my ability to think algorithmically, code efficiently, and push clean commits (most of the time). 

Projects- 

1. Number Guessing Game- A fun little console game where the computer randomly selects a number and the user tries to guess it with hints. Features: Random number generation, input validation, loop control, and suspense.
2. Simple Calculator- A basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Features: Switch-case usage, user input handling, and basic math operations.
3. To-Do List- A command-line to-do list application to add, view, and delete tasks. Features: File handling, dynamic task management, and a productivity boost (optional but encouraged).

Technologies Used- 
Language: C++-
IDE: Visual Studio
Version Control: Git & GitHub
